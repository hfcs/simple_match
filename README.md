# IPSC Match Management App

A robust, test-driven Flutter MVVM application for managing IPSC match stages, shooters, and scoring with scale factors. Modern UI, persistent storage, and export features.

## Features
- **Match Setup:** Configure stages (1-30) and scoring shoots (1-32)
- **Shooter Management:** Add shooters with unique names and scale factors (0.10–2.00)
- **Stage Input:** Record scores with mobile-friendly numeric input, validation, and error feedback
- **Results:** Calculate and display hit factors, adjusted hit factors, and rank shooters
- **Export:** Export all stage results to PDF
- **Persistence:** All data is auto-saved and restored using SharedPreferences
- **Clear All Data:** One-tap clear with confirmation
- **Modern UI:** Card-based, mobile-optimized, visually appealing

## Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern:**
  - Views: UI only (`lib/views/`)
  - ViewModels: Business logic (`lib/viewmodel/`)
  - Models: Data structures (`lib/models/`)
  - Services: Persistence (`lib/services/`)
- **State Management:** Provider
- **Persistence:**
  - Uses `shared_preferences` for local storage
  - **Data schema is versioned and backward compatible**
    - Schema version stored as `dataSchemaVersion` in SharedPreferences
    - Any schema change requires version bump, migration logic, and integration test
    - See `data_schema_history.md` and `docs/data_schema_versioning.md`

## Developer Workflow
- **Run app:** `flutter run`
- **Add dependency:** `flutter pub add <package>`
- **Test:** `flutter test`
- **Hot Reload:** Supported
- **Schema changes:**
  - Increment schema version in `PersistenceService` for breaking changes
  - Add migration logic and integration tests
  - Update `data_schema_history.md` and `docs/data_schema_versioning.md`

## Testing
- All features are covered by widget and logic tests (test-driven development)
- Migration logic is covered by integration tests in `test/persistence_test.dart`

## Test Coverage
- All core features are covered by unit, widget, and integration tests in `test/`
- ViewModel logic is tested (e.g., `test/viewmodel_main_menu_test.dart`, `test/viewmodel_match_setup_test.dart`)
- Persistence logic is tested (e.g., `test/services_test.dart`)
- Widget navigation and UI are tested (e.g., `test/widget_test.dart`)
- All TODOs for tests have been implemented and committed

## How to Run All Tests

```sh
flutter test --coverage
```

## Contributing
- Follow MVVM and Provider patterns
- Write or update tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Keep the codebase warning- and lint-free (`flutter analyze`)
- Document all schema changes and migrations
