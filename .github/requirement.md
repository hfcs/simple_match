This program will calculate hit factor of a IPSC shooting match, showing the total score and the calcuated hit factor

Taking input of 
- "Time" in format of seconds and 2 decimal sub-seconds, initialize to 0.00
- "A" in integer, initialize to 0
- "C" in integer, initialize to 0
- "D" in integer, initialize to 0
- "Misses" in integer, initialize to 0
- "No Shoots" in integer, initialize to 0
- "Procedure Errors" in integer, initialize to 0

Any removal of input value would reset the value to 0

Definition of hit factor =  "Time" / "Total score"

- "Total score" is an integer defined below
    - Each "A" scored is 5 points
    - Each "C" scored is 3 points
    - Each "D scored is 1 point
